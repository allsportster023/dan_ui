Things to consider:
 - How many Systems
 - How many Signals

MAX view area is 52vh

If there are X number of signals, it has to be Y height
Should there be a MIN size for system?
  - Is this driven by signal bar sizes?
Should there be a MAX size for system?
  - This must be a visual asthetic 

Each signal bar has to be at least # tall (Is this actually true..?)

Each signal bar has to be no larger than x
  - If one system and one signal, limit to 200px
  - If two systems and one signal, limit to 300px
  - If one system and 4+ signal, up the limit 
    - How?


What is the largest number of signals to display?
 - Is scrolling okay if it gets larger than screen?


Each signal bar needs to be at least #, but they cannot be larger than #
  Disregard the div VH variable and set a fixed size
    How?
